        --     → Expiration → Pandemic
        -- Reads as: does it show → where → how big → what it looks like → what is drawn on
        -- it → what changes it over time. A type that lacks a section just skips it (the bar
        -- card has no Stack Count or Duration Bar; only the bar has Size), so the surviving
        -- sections still appear in the same relative order on every card.
        --
        -- Show When Missing leads because it answers the prior question to all the rest —
        -- whether the indicator appears at all, rather than how it looks once it does.
        --
        -- ☠☠ THE NAMING RULES. This order drifted once already and the tell was subtle: the
        -- bar card called its looks section "Texture & Colors", which sounds harmless until
        -- you notice Frame Level and Alpha were living under it while every other card kept
        -- them in Appearance -- the same setting under three headings depending on which
        -- indicator you opened (Krathe, 2026-08-19). Hold to these:
        --
        --   * "Appearance" means what the thing looks like IN ISOLATION -- size, scale,
        --     colour, alpha, texture, frame level. ☠ NEVER split it by material ("Texture
        --     & Colors", "Fill & Outline"): that split has no natural seam, and every
        --     control added afterwards then has two plausible homes and picks one at random.
        --   * "Size" is its own section ONLY where a type has geometry the others lack (the
        --     bar's orientation, match-frame-width, inset). It sits between Position and
        --     Appearance. A type whose only size control is one slider keeps it inside
        --     Appearance rather than minting a one-row section.
        --   * Border / Duration Text / Stack Count / Duration Bar are things drawn ON TOP,
        --     and always follow Appearance in that order.
        --   * Expiration / Pandemic are what changes OVER TIME, and always come last.
        --   * A type lacking a section SKIPS it. It never reorders the survivors.
        --
        -- ★ Frame Level and Alpha are the canaries: they belong to Appearance on every type,
        -- without exception. If a review finds either anywhere else, the card has drifted.

    -- Every block gates on DF:FactoryOwnsAD(d). Only
    -- the settings GROUPS built above are targeted — the trigger tags (the
    -- working "which aura" layer) live in `parent` above `startY` and are left
    -- alone. "roadmap" = temporary (delete the single call site when the port
    -- lands); "limitation" = permanent (secret-value casualty).
    -- ============================================================

    if typeKey == "icon" or typeKey == "square" then
        -- P4.3/P4.5 SHIPPED: icon/square render on the container engine (native icon / solid
        -- fill + cooldown + stacks + border + position), AND Show When Missing now renders via
        -- the read-free missing-mode container (static spell icon / colour square while absent).
        -- The whole-type roadmap and the Show-When-Missing roadmap overlays are gone. Two
        -- surgical blocks remain:
        --   * Expiring -- REMOVED 2026-07-25. The whole group was remaining-time-driven,
        --     unreadable on the container path, so it is gone rather than frosted. The
        --     12.1-safe replacement is the DF.Expiration engine (the Expiry Alert group).
        --   * Min Stacks to Show — REMOVED 2026-07-25 (was a permanent limitation, then a
        --     confirmed no-op). Stack counts render on the native no-formatter path (a
        --     formatter would receive the SECRET application count and trap — see
        --     Features/Auras.lua's stacks-formatter warning), so a custom minimum other than
        --     the native "shown at >1" is not expressible. The control, its key and its
        --     defaults are gone rather than frosted.
        --   * Duration "Colour by Time" — P4.4 SHIPPED: the duration text now colours by
        --     time via the native bucket formatter (C-side |c escapes), so the roadmap
        --     overlay is gone and the control is fully editable under the factory.
    elseif typeKey == "bar" then
        -- P4.4 SHIPPED: the bar renders on the container engine (native SetDurationBar fill
        -- + texture/colour/orientation + border + duration text). The whole-type roadmap
        -- overlay is gone. One surgical block remains:
        --   * Expiring -- REMOVED 2026-07-25. The whole group was remaining-time-driven,
        --     unreadable on the container path, so it is gone rather than frosted. The
        --     12.1-safe replacement is the DF.Expiration engine (the Expiry Alert group).
    elseif typeKey == "sound" then
        -- P4.5 SHIPPED: the sound indicator plays natively via C_UnitAuras.AddAuraSound.
        -- The Sound Alert group (picker / volume / preview) and the per-event groups
        -- (Applied / Buff Dropped / Stack Gained) are all live and unblocked.
        -- REMOVED 2026-07-25 -- Missing Trigger and Expire Alert. "Alert WHILE the buff is
        -- absent" is presence-driven and no native hook fires during absence; "alert as the
        -- buff FADES" is remaining-time-driven. Both were permanently frosted, and Expire
        -- Alert's intent is now served natively by Buff Dropped (the Removed trigger), so
        -- the groups and their ten inert keys are gone rather than left as dead controls.
    elseif typeKey == "nametext" or typeKey == "healthtext" then
        -- RECOVERED (colour-by-cover): the base Color works — the Text Designer keeps a
        -- glyph-identical coloured cover in sync with the real element (Render mirrors)
        -- and the aura slot's secret visibility shows it on presence. Two surgical blocks:
        --   * Show When Missing is not built for text covers at all - the checkbox is
        --     simply never created for them. A cover is SetAllPoints onto the real
        --     FontString, so its screen rect belongs to the text it mirrors; missing mode
        --     hides by MOVING a badge, so parking/pushing could never change what shows.
        --     (Same control SHIPPED for border/healthbar/background, whose art really does
        --     live inside the window.) Candidate path if it is ever wanted:
        --     SetAlphaFromBoolean(presence, 0, 255) on the mirror - on SimpleRegion as well
        --     as SimpleFrame, AllowedWhenTainted, and taking both alphas makes inversion
        --     free. Open question is sourcing `presence` as a SECRET BOOLEAN we can pass
        --     through without reading: an unrun in-game probe.
        --   * Expiring -- REMOVED 2026-07-25. The whole group was remaining-time-driven,
        --     unreadable on the container path, so it is gone rather than frosted. The
        --     12.1-safe replacement is the DF.Expiration engine (the Expiry Alert group).
    elseif typeKey == "healthbar" or typeKey == "background" or typeKey == "border" then
        -- Base effect settings (colour / mode / style) work on the container
        -- engine. Two surgical blocks on top:
        --   * Expiring -- REMOVED 2026-07-25. The whole group was remaining-time-driven,
        --     unreadable on the container path, so it is gone rather than frosted. The
        --     12.1-safe replacement is the DF.Expiration engine (the Expiry Alert group).
        --   * Show When Missing — P4.5 SHIPPED: the effect now renders via the read-free
        --     missing-mode container (tint / ring shown while the buff is absent), so the
        --     roadmap overlay is gone and the checkbox is fully editable under the factory.
        --   * Tint Entire Bar (healthbar only) — NO LONGER blocked. The filled health-mirror
        --     bar makes the current-health-fill variant (tintWholeBar=false) expressible
        --     read-free, so both settings work under the factory.
        --   * Gradient border style -- UNFROSTED 2026-07-25 to test the claim behind it.
        --     The frost said gradient "needs a resolved rect to compute its direction+
        --     extent" and so degrades to solid on a secret-anchored slot. Re-reading
        --     Border.lua that looks wrong on two counts: the gradient path measures
        --     NOTHING (it is SetColorTexture + SetGradient on SetPoint-anchored edges --
        --     no GetWidth/GetHeight anywhere in Apply), and Apply's gradient branch is
        --     gated on `style == "GRADIENT" and gradient and CreateColor` with no
        --     _solidOnly check, so the slot's solidOnly flag never blocked the paint.
        --     solidOnly is about secret COLOURS (CreateColor taints on them), which the
        --     gradient pickers are not -- they are static config. secretRect is the flag
        --     that handles rects, and only TEXTURE style needs it. If gradient still
        --     renders solid in game, the cause is something not yet found and the block
        --     should come back with the real reason recorded.
