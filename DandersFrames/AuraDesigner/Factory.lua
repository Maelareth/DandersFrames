-- AURA DESIGNER — NATIVE FACTORY BRIDGE (P4.x)
--
-- The 12.1 revival path for the Aura Designer. On live (pre-12.1) clients the
-- legacy AuraDesigner\Engine.lua read-path still drives every indicator; on 12.1
-- the aura-read API is sealed, so that engine renders nothing. This bridge rebuilds
-- AD indicators on the Blizzard-driven container system (DF.AuraContainer) instead:
-- identity comes from the STATIC per-spec spell-ID whitelist (Config.SpellIDs), and
-- Blizzard drives each slot's secret show/hide — we only attach art. Zero secret reads.
--
-- SCOPE (this file, P4.0 scaffold + P4.1 + P4.2 + P4.3 + P4.4): gates, identity->includeSpellIDs,
-- the frame-level indicators that CAN be driven read-free — HEALTH-BAR (fill cover + flat
-- tint), BACKGROUND tint, static BORDER — and the PLACED ICON / SQUARE / BAR indicators (native
-- SetIcon / solid-colour fill + native cooldown + native stacks + static border for icon/square;
-- a native SetDurationBar-driven StatusBar for the bar, one 1-slot container per configured
-- indicator, many coexisting). Placed duration text supports colour-by-time via the #205 discrete
-- BUCKET formatter (C-side |c escapes — no Lua time read). nametext / healthtext were recovered
-- via colour-by-cover; framealpha remains a 12.1 casualty (see NOTES at the file foot).
-- Sound + showWhenMissing are P4.5. The factory
-- is the only AD render path now — the legacy read-path engine was removed.
--
-- COMBAT / SECRET obligations (delegated to the DF.AuraContainer handle, the #205-proven
-- path): containers are created/enabled OUT of combat and deferred to PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED
-- in lockdown (Create/_deferRebuild, Rebuild/_deferRebuild, ApplyStyle/_pendingRestyle,
-- ApplyTuning/_pendingTuning — the Wave-1 in-place group tuning path);
-- SetEnabled runs LAST; identity is static config, never a live aura's spellId/duration/
-- applications/dispelName. SyncFrame's own per-tick work is a cheap sig-compare table walk
-- and only touches a handle on an actual config change (build-once-leave-it).

-- IDENTITY  (static spell-ID whitelist -> native includeSpellIDs map)
-- A { includeSpellIDs = map } candidate-filter table Blizzard evaluates
-- container-side. Built purely from STATIC data — the per-spec config plus the
-- shipped SpellDB — never from a live aura. Returns nil when the aura name has
-- no known spell ID (caller then skips — an empty include map would wrongly
-- match EVERY helpful aura).
-- `spec` may be NIL (the Other Buffs pool, B1): the per-spec Config tables can't match
-- a nil spec key, so resolution is spec-INDEPENDENT by construction — ad-hoc "#<id>"
-- first, then SpellDB by name. Other-pool names must therefore be SpellDB names
-- (rec.n / localized) or ad-hoc keys; curated INTERNAL names ("PowerWordShield") only
-- resolve through a spec.
-- ============================================================
-- ★ PER-PLACEMENT NARROWING. A curated aura resolves to the UNION of its spell IDs, which
-- is right for "never silently miss an effect" and wrong for anyone who wants one of them.
-- Reported as: Beacon of the Savior carries the beacon buff (1244893) AND an absorb buff
-- (1244878), and there was no way to place the beacon as a square without the absorb
-- coming with it — adding it by ID snapped to the curated name and re-widened.
--
-- Stored as MUTES (ids to drop) rather than an include subset, matching the Filter page's
-- own filterMutedSpellIDs: an id the SpellDB adds LATER keeps being tracked instead of
-- silently going missing, and an absent key means today's behaviour byte-for-byte.
-- ☠ SCOPE: this is placement-scoped and the filter store is filter-scoped. They are
-- deliberately separate — muting an id for your Buff Bar filter must not silently retarget
-- an AD square, and vice versa.
--
-- ☠ ALWAYS BUILDS A FRESH TABLE. Two of the resolver's paths hand back memory that is not
-- ours: the filter-ref path returns a map held in adFilterRefCache, and the curated path is
-- built from Adapter:GetAuraSpellIDs, whose array is cached and shared. Narrowing in place
-- would corrupt the cache for every other consumer of that spell.

    -- it" contract — the caller then renders no container at all.
    -- ☠ NEVER an empty includeSpellIDs. An empty include map matches EVERY helpful aura,
    -- which is the exact failure this resolver exists to prevent; "shows nothing" and
    -- "shows everything" are one typo apart here.
    -- The second return distinguishes "the user ticked nothing" from "we could not resolve
    -- this aura", so the unresolved warning does not fire on a deliberate choice.
    -- (This used to keep the FULL set instead, back when the card refused to untick the
    -- last id. That refusal is gone — it forced the eye to do a job the ticks should do —
    -- so the render has to be able to express the empty set.)

-- ★ Does this placement currently match NOTHING — i.e. has the user unticked every one of

--   * the editor canvas, which must draw no preview (a canvas showing what the frame will
--     not is the divergence class this addon keeps paying for);
--   * the card, which greys the eye so the state is legible instead of mysterious.
-- ☠ NOT the same as "unresolvable". An aura the resolver cannot identify also yields no
-- map, but that is a data problem rather than a choice — which is why the resolver returns
-- a second value instead of leaving every call site to guess from a nil.
-- Cheap-exits before resolving when there are no mutes at all, which is every indicator in
-- every profile that has not touched this feature.

-- ============================================================
-- BUFF-BAR DEDUP UNION  (derived — the exclusion set the buff row folds in)
-- The union of every spell ID tracked by ANY configured Aura Designer indicator for the
-- frame's ACTIVE spec. Recomputed from the AD config (the source of truth) whenever the
-- buff row rebuilds, so it stays correct across indicator add/remove, whole-aura delete,
-- profile import/switch and spec change with NO stored state and NO refcount. Read-free
-- (static config only): walks adDB.auras[spec] and unions BuildADIdentityFilters (primary
-- + alternates) for every aura carrying at least one configured indicator of ANY type.
-- "Tracked" = the aura has an indicator the factory actually RENDERS ON THE BUFF SLOT (i.e.
-- while the aura is PRESENT) on 12.1: a PRESENT-mode placed indicator (icon/square/bar) or a
-- PRESENT-mode frame-level key (border / healthbar / background). Two deliberate exclusions:
--   * SOUND — now recovered (P4.5: it PLAYS on-apply via C_UnitAuras.AddAuraAppliedSound), but
--     a sound is NOT a visual replacement for the buff icon. A sound-only aura must keep showing
--     on the buff bar (audio cue + visible icon), so sound is DELIBERATELY excluded from the
--     dedup union even though it renders (plays). (nametext / healthtext / framealpha remain
--     casualties that render nothing — also excluded, add back if/when recovered.)
--   * SHOW-WHEN-MISSING indicators — a missing-mode indicator shows NOTHING while the aura is
--     present (it only appears on ABSENCE), so the buff-bar icon is the aura's only present-time
--     visual and must not be hidden. A missing-ONLY aura therefore contributes nothing to dedup.
--   * HIDDEN indicators (eye toggle, `enabled == false`; nil/true = shown for legacy records) —
--     a hidden indicator renders nothing, so it must not count as tracked (its buff-row icon
--     comes back). Same gate the render paths use (SyncFrame placed loop + pickWinner).
--   * OTHERS-ONLY indicators (`othersOnly == true`, B1) — they render only OTHERS' casts
--     ("HELPFUL|!PLAYER"), so deduping would leave the player's OWN cast with no visual
--     anywhere. A spell counts as tracked only via its non-othersOnly blocks: a mixed record
--     (one othersOnly + one normal indicator) still dedups (the normal one shows the self-
--     cast), an all-othersOnly spell keeps its buff-row icon. Visible duplication of others'
--     casts is the lesser evil vs silent self-invisibility — and with the buff row's Only
--     Mine filter the two are perfectly disjoint (row = your cast, AD = others'). Gated
--     identically for BOTH pools (spec-pool records could carry the flag someday).
-- Returns nil when AD is disabled, off-spec, empty, or the factory doesn't own AD for this db
-- (caller then contributes nothing). BUFF (HELPFUL) only: every AD entry is a helpful aura, and
-- a harmful map is inert on friendly frames.
-- FILTER-GROUP RESOLUTION CACHE (A5 hot-path). Resolving a group's selection
-- walks the registry and signing it sorts the full id map (100+ ids for preset
-- links) — too heavy to run per frame per aura event. Cache the resolved result
-- AND its signature per GROUP TABLE (weak keys: deleted groups GC), keyed to
-- DF.auraLayoutVersion: every live-link invalidation (filter edit via the
-- DirectFilterChangedProxy chain, group link/unlink, eye toggle, custom-filter
-- delete) already bumps that version. Within a version, SyncFrame does a plain
-- string compare of the cached sig; on a version change each group resolves +
-- signs exactly ONCE (SelectionSignature takes the pre-resolved result — no
-- double resolve). Profile/spec switches swap the group TABLES themselves, so
-- identity keying self-invalidates even without a version bump.

-- CONDITION GROUPS  (AND across groups, OR within a group)

--                  { mode = "ANY", triggers = {...} } },
--   }
--
-- ☠ WHY ONLY "ALL of ANY" RENDERS TODAY. The two operators cost completely different
-- things on 12.1:
--   * OR is FREE. A container's candidateFilters is already a spell-ID SET, so "any of
--     these" is one union in one container — exactly what the flat trigger list does.
--   * AND needs the containers STACKED. There is no read available to test two auras at
--     once, so instead each group builds a container whose slot-child frame hosts the
--     next group's container: the innermost can only be visible when every outer one is
--     too, and the game evaluated the conjunction for us. Proven in game 2026-08-09,
--     including with the buffs applied in either order and in combat.
-- So "ALL of ANY groups" is ONE chain with one visual at the end — the shape the
-- mechanism natively has. "ANY of ALL groups" ((X and Y) or (Z and W)) would need one
-- chain PER term and therefore one visual per term, which double-renders translucent
-- tints (measured in game: 25% -> 44% -> 58% over one, two and three chains), so it is
-- DISTRIBUTED into the first form by distributeTerms below rather than rendered as
-- written. Both shapes therefore draw through a single chain.
--
-- ☠ DEFINED ABOVE unionIdentity ON PURPOSE. Its caller is a `local function` too, so a
-- definition placed after it compiles the name as a GLOBAL — nil at call time, and a
-- runtime error the syntax check cannot see. That is exactly how it shipped first.

-- Absent `conditions` = the legacy flat `triggers` list = a single OR group. Nothing

-- `conditions.mode` alone fixes the shape — the groups are always the OPPOSITE operator, so

--     mode = "ALL"  ->  groups are ORs   ->  (A or B) and (C or D)   -- renders directly
--     mode = "ANY"  ->  groups are ANDs  ->  (A and B) or (C and D)  -- distributed above
-- Between them that covers every two-level expression in either normal form.
--
-- Returns nil when there is no renderable chain: no conditions block, fewer than two
-- groups, an empty group, a group that resolves to no spells, or an expansion over the
-- link cap. Refusing beats rendering: an unresolvable group would silently widen the
-- conjunction to "ignore this condition", which is worse than showing nothing.
-- Second return is the would-be link count, for the editor's over-cap message.

-- each had `bestPool` in hand on the adjacent line for poolFilter.
--
-- The divergence is not theoretical: an Other-Buffs effect on a Restoration Druid triggered
-- by Lifebloom resolves to {33763, 419207, 1227806} through the nil-spec path that drives
-- bestMap and the dedup union, but to {33763} through SpellIDs.RestorationDruid here. The
-- buff row has already hidden the variant icon via dedup while the chain never lights for
-- it -- the aura becomes invisible everywhere. Same for Rejuvenation, Regrowth and

-- AddAuraSlot, so every consumer folds it into its struct sig (toggling rebuilds).
-- NOTE: the on-apply SOUND path can't honour othersOnly (AddAuraAppliedSound has no
-- caster filter) — sounds fire for any caster's application.
-- mine = the SPEC pool (My Buffs tab): ONLY the player's own casts light anything

-- players saw indicators fire for the other player's buffs). The OTHER pool is
-- unchanged: anyone-cast, or "HELPFUL|!PLAYER" when the effect is othersOnly.
-- ACCEPTED consequence: the buff-bar dedup exclude map is caster-agnostic, so with
-- Hide Duplicate Buffs on, OTHER players' casts of a My-Buffs-tracked spell render
-- nowhere (not on the PLAYER-filtered indicator, not on the bar). Narrowing the
-- dedup to the player's own casts is a tracked follow-up, not this hotfix.
-- SELF_ONLY: a third `mine` value, not a boolean. See resolvePoolMode below for what

-- a My Buffs indicator for such a spell has never rendered on the player's own frame
-- at all — not a regression, it has never worked. Config's SelfOnlySpellIDs documented

--
-- ☠ SCOPED TO THE PLAYER'S OWN FRAME, deliberately. Relaxing everywhere would light
-- your indicator from another player's cast on an ally, which is precisely the
-- complaint that made the spec pool player-only ("it's literally in the name",
-- 2026-07-16). UnitIsUnit rather than `unit == "player"`: in raid frames the player's
-- own frame is a raidN unit, so the string test would silently never match.
--
-- ⚠ ACCEPTED over-match: one container has one filter string, so on your own frame the
-- slot now matches the aura whoever cast it — a second druid linking to YOU would light
-- it. Strictly better than never rendering, and not narrowable without splitting the
-- container. Flagged to the lab for a field check.
--

-- LEVEL CONSTANTS (single retune point — bug #1027)
-- The container nests anchor -> native AuraContainer -> AuraSlot button, each a default
-- +1 child, and the painted regions hang off the BUTTON — so an overlay's visual lands at
--     anchor level + frameLevelOffset + 2
-- (same measured arithmetic as Frames/Create.lua:672-679). A condition-chain GATE hands
-- its mirror host back one level deeper still (a plain child frame of the button):
--     anchor level + frameLevelOffset + 3
-- That +2/+3 is derived from the code's default-child nesting, not from a live /fstack —
-- if an in-game check disagrees, retune the two constants below and nothing else.
--
--   * AD_HEALTHBAR_COVER_OFFSET seats the Health Bar Color cover (both variants: fill
--     cover and whole-bar tint). Intended seat is healthBar+1 — above the real fill,
--     BELOW the attached absorb bar at healthBar+2 (Bars.lua:790/:1036) and the +2 power
--     bar, exactly where the legacy tint sat — so -1 + 2 nesting = +1. The old value (1)
--     landed the cover at healthBar+3, occluding the absorb shield (bug #1027).
--   * AD_CHAIN_GATE_OFFSET makes a chain gate LEVEL-NEUTRAL: -3 + 3 nesting parks the
--     gate's mirror host at the anchor's own level, so the FINAL visual link — created on
--     that host with the consumer's own offset — seats exactly where the flat path puts
--     it, for ANY chain length. If chained effects render N levels above their flat twin
--     in game, lower this by N. The gate paints nothing itself, so its own level only has
--     to be legal — ApplyZOrder clamps at 0, which can lift a gate (and therefore the
--     visual) a level or two ONLY on a unit frame whose own level is under 3.

-- Text-mirror chain gates keep the mirror-host band (+30): the visual link there is

-- === HELPER-GATE OWNERSHIP ===
-- Stamps `dfGate` onto a container config so AuraContainer's funnel can recognise it as the
-- Power Infusion Helper's and darken it. `src` is the effect config the recipe wrote, which
-- carries `pihSignal`; anything without that mark is left completely untouched.
--
-- ONE HELPER, CALLED AT EVERY SITE -- Danders' condition when he took this route over
-- threading a parameter through six shared builders. The point is that a site which forgets to
-- stamp reads as an ABSENT LINE in a known list rather than as an invisible omission. Do not
-- inline the assignment at a call site; add the call.
--
-- Returns its first argument, so it wraps a builder in place:
--     DF.AuraContainer:Create(frame, stampGate(buildBorderConfig(...), cfg))
-- Builders that already receive the effect config (placed indicators take `indicator`, filter
-- groups take `group`) stamp INSIDE themselves instead -- there is nothing to forget there.
--
-- SHOW-WHEN-MISSING IS NOT STAMPED, deliberately. applyGroupTuning early-returns on
-- mode == "missing", so a missing-mode container cannot be live-gated at all; stamping it
-- would advertise a gate that never fires. The helper does not offer SWM on gated effects.
-- ☠ THE INFUSED SIGNAL IS EXEMPT FROM THE GATE, and the exemption is the signal.
-- Casting Power Infusion is what starts its cooldown, so "someone has my Power Infusion" is
-- only ever true while the gate is dark -- a gated infused mark turns on and is hidden in the
-- same instant, every time (field-found: the violet was invisible until the gate was switched
-- off). Ungated, it shows where the buff went for its 15 seconds while everything else stays
-- hidden. The exemption also skips the role exclusions, accepted: "this player genuinely has
-- Power Infusion" is true whatever their role. One predicate so the rule cannot drift apart
-- across the stamp sites.

-- levelOffset is added on top of the caller's anchor level; the tint texture then lands a

--     it would never build the region. The colour VALUE restyles live.

-- ============================================================
-- EXPIRY ALERT ELEMENT  (placed icon/square/bar indicators only)
-- A per-indicator FontString that shows the configured custom text / glyph
-- only while the tracked aura's remaining time is below the threshold —
-- natively driven by a SetDurationText binding whose formatter renders the
-- payload below the threshold and an EMPTY string above it (C-side band
-- evaluation against the SECRET remaining time, zero Lua reads).
--
-- Delivery mechanism — in-game probe history:
--   * a243064 parented the region OUTSIDE the button subtree (unit frame):
--     soft-rejected — the binding neither errored nor drove it.
--   * 014b1bb bound a button-child region as a SECOND SetDurationText on the
--     indicator's own button: REPLACE semantics — the second bind killed the
--     indicator's duration text (and above the threshold the alert's empty
--     band renders nothing, so NO text rendered at all). One duration binding
--     per button is the rule.
-- The mechanism is therefore an invisible COMPANION SLOT per alerted
-- indicator — see the EXPIRY ALERT COMPANION SLOT section further down (after
-- the layout builders it borrows). The indicator's own button carries exactly
-- one duration binding (dfDur), byte-identical to pre-alert behaviour whether
-- the alert is ON or OFF.

-- it). Size/anchor are computed inside the engine's StructSig / BuildDurationSpec /

-- effectiveAlertSize/Anchor.

-- Returns nil for INHERIT/unset so the apply site falls back to the parent's strata, which
-- is also what RESTORES inheritance when a user switches back (a frame always has a strata;
-- there is no "unset" to write). Whitelisted rather than passed through: SetFrameStrata
-- errors on an unknown string, and this value can arrive from an imported profile.
-- ☠ BACKGROUND AND LOW ARE DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. They used to be, and a stored
-- "BACKGROUND" pinned an indicator below every MEDIUM frame on the unit button — the health
-- bar included — where no frame level could ever lift it, because strata outranks level
-- absolutely. The per-indicator picker that wrote them was removed from the editor, so the

-- health bar with a Frame Level slider that did nothing (field-proven by a /df debug zorder
-- dump, 2026-08-19 — strata=BACKGROUND at level 106 losing to a health bar at level 7).

-- which is the baseline the absolute-levels migrations were built for.

-- resolveDefCBT exists — render and editor must walk the SAME fallback chain, or a stored

-- ☠ EVERY key the editor's GLOBAL_DEFAULT_MAP offers must appear here, or the setting is a
-- LIE. The editor proxy (Options/AuraDesigner/UI/Groups.lua) falls back to adDB.defaults for
-- DISPLAY, but it only copy-on-reads TABLES back onto the instance — a scalar the user never
-- touched stays nil on the record, and the Factory then rendered its own hardcoded literal.
-- So Global Defaults could show Icon Size 32 while every untouched indicator kept rendering

-- ============================================================
-- EXPIRY ALERT COMPANION SLOT
-- One duration binding per button (in-game verified on 014b1bb: a second
-- SetDurationText call REPLACES the first — the indicator's own countdown went
-- dead), so the alert cannot ride the indicator's button. Each ALERTED placed
-- indicator instead gets an invisible COMPANION container: same spell map /
-- filter / geometry as the indicator — its 1-slot button coincides with the
-- indicator's rect, derived from CONFIG values only (the same layout builders
-- that position the indicator itself; no rect reads, §20c). No icon, no swipe,
-- no border, no stacks: the companion's ONLY output is the alert text, driven
-- through THAT button's single native duration binding with the alert-element
-- formatter (payload below threshold, EMPTY above — C-side, secret-safe).
-- expiryAlertAnchor/OffsetX/OffsetY place the text at that anchor point on the
-- (invisible) button; expiryAlertSize drives the font (TEXT) / |A escape
-- (GLYPH) size.
--
-- Handle family: companions live in the SAME store.placed family as their
-- indicators, keyed "<placedKey>:alert" (collision-proof: placedKey ends in
-- "#<id>"). Ensure / struct-vs-cosmetic sig compare / end-of-pass live-sweep
-- and ClearFrame's store.placed teardown all apply unchanged.
--
-- COMBAT COST: one extra standing container per ALERTED indicator ONLY —
-- OFF-mode indicators get no companion (their key is never marked live, so
-- the sweep destroys any stale one). Dedup: the companion tracks the exact
-- spell map its indicator already tracks, and the buff-row dedup union
-- (GetADTrackedSpellIDs) is built from the CONFIG records, not from live
-- handles — the companion adds nothing to it.
-- ============================================================
-- How far the alert is lifted above the thing it annotates. ONE constant, used by the live
-- companion (over its indicator's container) and by the AD canvas (over its preview slot),
-- so the two can never be nudged apart by editing one literal. At the +1 this used to be,
-- the companion's button landed at +3, INSIDE its own indicator's band: above that
-- indicator's icon but under its border, and under every sibling indicator's border at the
-- same configured level. That is why the glyph showed under the icons.
--
-- ☠ 13 -> 8 (Z-order review, 2026-08-07) -> 10 (2026-08-08). RE-MEASURED, as the previous
-- revision of this comment instructed, because the holder ladder moved again.
--
-- The 2026-08-07 pass measured a row at 7 thick against a ladder topping out at +5. That
-- ladder was wrong: it left the dispel ring under the icon border and no room beneath the
-- border for a pandemic tint. The corrected ladder is `DF.AuraButtonLevels`
-- (Frames/AuraContainer.lua) and runs button+2..+7, so measured from the container —
-- container +0, button +2, border +5, holders +4..+9 — a row is now **9 thick**.
--
-- 10 clears that with a level spare, and keeps an indicator plus its alert inside 19
-- levels, which is what lets the user-facing bands sit 20 apart. That is now a TIGHT fit:
-- one more rung on the ladder costs two levels here and busts the band.
-- RE-MEASURE THIS if the border level or the holder ladder moves again.
Factory.ALERT_ROW_LIFT = 10

-- ☠ ...EXCEPT FOR TINT, which wants the opposite. A wash covers the whole icon, so lifting
-- it a full row puts it over the indicator's own duration text and stack count and makes
-- both hard to read (Krathe, 2026-08-05 — the same fault the pandemic cue had, same fix).
-- A wash belongs ABOVE the icon art and BELOW everything carrying information.
--
-- ★ +1 is exactly where this started. The comment above records that at +1 "the companion's
-- button landed at +3, INSIDE its own indicator's band: above that indicator's icon but
-- under its border" — which was the bug for a GLYPH and is precisely what a TINT wants. The
-- constant was never wrong, it was MODE-BLIND: +1 is right for a wash and wrong for a
-- payload, +13 is right for a payload and wrong for a wash.
--
-- ⚠ The trade the low lift buys back is that a tint also sits under a SIBLING indicator's
-- border at the same configured level. That is the correct side of it — a wash is
-- background — and the alternative is the unreadable timer this fixes.
Factory.ALERT_TINT_LIFT = 1

-- split is exactly how the two drifted apart on layering twice over.
--
-- The reveal's duration spec (formatter + placement + opacity) is engine-owned; the factory
-- only wraps it in AuraContainer plumbing. geom (alertGeometry) is the target's shape — a
-- square for an icon (auto-match), a rectangle for a bar (Tint fills it).
--
-- nil = no reveal, for any of three reasons: the master toggle is off / the type is unset
-- (Expiration:Mode), the pre-12.1 formatter API is missing, or the indicator is
-- SHOW-WHEN-MISSING. That last gate used to live only on the canvas path, so live built a
-- companion for missing-mode indicators anyway — and since the companion is a NORMAL
-- (non-inverted) container, it revealed while the aura was PRESENT, i.e. exactly when the
-- indicator under it was hidden. A floating alert over nothing. "Warn me before this runs
-- out" and "show me while this is absent" are contradictory settings; the canvas and the
-- surrounding comments already treated it as nonsensical, so live now agrees with them.

--     elements nor spacing, so the survivors close up in the configured order
--
-- The container's own `style`/`layout` stay the GROUP's (its Appearance section and
-- its anchor/growth/spacing/wrap) — that is the base a member style overrides, and

-- exposed form of the row's own resolver — so a group configured like the row
-- produces byte-identical records (per-record filter strings, negation-token
-- dedup, Hide Long / Keep Important semantics, the > 0 minutes guard). One
-- handle per enabled group per frame, keyed "dgroup:<id>" in store.dgroups —
-- the same live/sweep lifecycle as the A5 filter groups. Empty selection (no
-- categories) resolves to NO records -> the group renders nothing and is swept.
-- The facade NEVER passes a claim set (claims derive from these very groups —

-- MEMBER LAYOUT GROUPS — position arranger (12.1 port)
-- A member ("classic") layout group arranges its members' PLACED indicators in
-- a grid computed from the group's settings (anchor / offset / grow direction /
-- icons per row / spacing). Legacy applied this at render time over the ACTIVE
-- members only (the legacy Engine group-offset pass, since removed — icons compacted as auras came
-- and went); on 12.1 aura presence is SECRET, so slots are STATIC: each member
-- owns the grid cell of its member index, exactly matching the editor preview
-- (Options.lua RefreshPlacedIndicators). An absent (or eye-hidden) member
-- leaves its cell empty — no compaction, by design (read-free).
--
-- Mechanics: positions are recomputed per SyncFrame pass from the LIVE group
-- tables (cheap arithmetic — group edits apply immediately, no version cache to
-- go stale) into pass-stamped scratch. Each member gets a persistent WRAPPER
-- table (__index = its indicator record) whose anchor/offsetX/offsetY are the
-- arranged values; the placed sync below reads position through the wrapper, so
-- the arranged position flows into the container layout AND the cosmetic sig
-- (group edits hot-apply via ApplyStyle). Zero steady-state allocation: wrapper
-- + entry alloc once per instanceKey, mutated in place thereafter.

-- SHOW-WHEN-MISSING  — P4.5
-- An indicator/effect with showWhenMissing set INVERTS its trigger: it renders while the
-- tracked aura is ABSENT (a "you're missing this" reminder) instead of on presence. Driven
-- READ-FREE by DF.AuraContainer's mode="missing" layout-push inversion (probe 32): a clip
-- WINDOW parks a handle-owned BADGE inside itself while the spellID-filtered group is empty
-- (aura absent); one blank button's cell pushes the badge fully out of the window when the
-- aura is present (renders nothing). We size the window/badge to the indicator's art and style
-- the badge from GetBadgeFrame(). Zero secret reads — identity + geometry + colour are static
-- config; Blizzard's secret show/hide drives the push.
--
-- SCOPE: icon / square (placed) and border / healthbar / background (frame-level). BARS are
-- excluded — legacy has no missing mode for bars (no duration data when absent, Engine.lua:510),
-- and the GUI never offered showWhenMissing for a bar. Cooldown / duration text / stacks are
-- NOT rendered on a missing indicator (nothing to count when the aura is absent).
--
-- ANIMATION: missing-window borders must NEVER animate. The badge border is a handle-owned
-- DF.Border (secretRect -> its animation driver hosts on UIParent), and the badge is NOT a slot
-- in any handle's self.buttons, so _teardownContainer's StopAnimation loop never reaches it — an
-- animated badge would leave an orphaned ticker running forever. So every missing badge-border
-- spec is hard-nilled (spec.animation = nil), exactly the missing-buff badge precedent
-- (Features/Auras.lua:3122). (StopAnimation is not cleanly reachable from the AD missing teardown
-- for the same "badge isn't in self.buttons" reason, so hard-nil is the correct choice here.)

-- HELPER SOUND -- ARMED / DISARMED (Power Infusion helper)
-- ============================================================
-- ☠ SOUND IS NOT A CONTAINER, so the candidate-filter gate cannot reach it. Left alone it
-- would keep announcing burst windows while the helper is meant to be silent -- worse than
-- having no sound at all, because a signal that lies costs more than one that is missing. It
-- therefore gets its own edge action: unregister on gate-close, re-register on gate-open.
--
-- ☠ ITS OWN STORE, NEVER store.sound. reconcileSoundNow tears down every entry in store.sound
-- that is not in the `desired` set it just built -- and helper registrations are never in it,
-- because collectDesiredSounds deliberately refuses filter-owned records. Put them there and
-- the next reconcile silently kills them.
--
-- ☠ WHY BYPASSING collectDesiredSounds IS LEGITIMATE HERE. That bar exists because the native
-- path is per (unit, spellID), so a 600-spell filter would mean 600 registrations per unit.
-- The helper's list is bounded and class-narrowed below, which is the case the rule was not
-- written for. The rule itself stays, and SyncSound's combat deferral is untouched.
--
-- Registration legality in combat is WATCHED, not assumed: AddAuraSound / RemoveAuraSound are
-- legal in lockdown, a registration made mid-combat audibly fires, and registering for an
-- ALREADY-ACTIVE aura fires nothing -- so a gate re-open mid-fight replays no backlog.

-- Class narrowing. The native path costs one registration per (unit, spellID): the helper's
-- ~60 cooldowns across a 5-man party is ~300, and a raid ~1200, toggled twice per gate cycle.
-- A unit's CLASS is readable (only spec is secret), so each unit only needs its own class's
-- cooldowns -- roughly a sixfold cut that scales with group size.
--
-- ⚠ NARROWING IS BY THE TARGET UNIT'S CLASS, and a record's `class` is the class that OWNS the
-- spell -- the CASTER's. For burst cooldowns those coincide (they are self-buffs), which is
-- why this is right for the helper's real list. For a buff cast ON someone else it is wrong:
-- Power Word: Shield is class=PRIEST but lands on anyone. The helper's own list is only ever
-- self-buffs, so narrowing is always on: `Factory._helperSoundNarrow` is read but no longer
-- written, the switch having gone with the test commands. Set it false from a debug session
-- if a cast-on-others buff ever needs registering.
-- Every id in the map is now a real spell. It did not used to be: an earlier ownership marker
-- rode here as a synthetic id and had to be filtered back out, because registering a sound on it
-- armed a trigger that could never fire AND made the registration count look healthy while
-- nothing was listening. The mark moved onto the container config (`dfGate`), so the whole
-- exclusion went with it.

-- ============================================================
-- MULTI-TINT HEALTH BAR / BACKGROUND  (one container per configured tint)
-- These two used to run through pickWinner — ONE static winner per type — which meant a
-- lower-priority buff could never colour the bar even when it was the ONLY buff present
-- (presence is secret; a config-time pick cannot ask what is on the unit). Field report
-- 2026-08-13. Now every configured tint gets its own engine presence-gated container, so
-- whichever buff is actually up colours the frame. When SEVERAL are up at once the
-- arbitration is DRAW ORDER: the family shares one frame level (the healthBar+1 cover
-- band is a single level wide — the attached absorb at +2 is a hard ceiling, bug #1027 —
-- so there is no room for a level ladder), and same-level render order follows frame
-- creation order. The sync loop therefore enforces two rules:
--   * CREATE ASCENDING: collectFrameTints sorts lowest priority FIRST (the exact reverse
--     of pickWinner's winner-first order), so the highest-priority tint is created last
--     and draws on top — an opaque Replace cover fully hides the rest, restoring the v4
--     "highest present priority wins"; translucent Tints compose, top-most last.
--   * REPAIR THE LADDER: a (re)created container takes a fresh global draw index, so a
--     mid-list Create/Rebuild would jump above older higher-priority siblings. The loop
--     recreates every non-chained tint AFTER the first (re)created one, and an
--     order-signature change (a priority edit that crosses another tint, an add/remove)
--     tears the whole family down to recreate in order.
-- ☠ CONDITION-CHAINED tints are exempt from the ladder: their visual container is born
-- when the last gating buff lands (buildConditionChain is lazy by necessity), a runtime
-- the sync loop cannot order. A chained tint's draw position among simultaneous tints is
-- best-effort — accepted; conditions are rare and curate their own visibility.
-- SHOW-WHEN-MISSING stays SINGLE-WINNER (the highest-priority SWM config): "absent" is
-- the resting state of most frames, so several missing badges would sit composed over
-- every idle frame — the one-badge contract is kept deliberately.
-- ============================================================

-- The same candidate set pickWinner scores, as a LIST — both pools, enabled, colour set,
-- identity resolved. Sorted lowest priority first; ties reverse pickWinner's exactly
-- (spec pool and alphabetically-smaller names sort LATER = draw on top), so with a single
-- candidate the rendered result is identical to the old winner's.

-- /df debug adgate — AURA DESIGNER gate ground truth
-- ============================================================
-- Companion to /df debug idgate, and it exists because that dump could not answer the
-- question it kept being reached for. idgate walks AuraContainer._handles and
-- _slotHandles, so it sees a placement's HANDLE but never the chain around it, never the
-- DF-owned badge textures, and never that a link opted out of managing its own visibility.
-- An AD indicator rendering while every handle in idgate reports hidden is invisible to
-- it -- which is exactly the state that stalled this (Krathe, 2026-08-18).
--
-- Answers, per placement: chain length, which links are parent-driven (those NEVER hide
-- themselves, see Handle:_applyVisibility), each link's gate verdict, and what each link's
-- frame plus the badge is ACTUALLY showing. A row whose gate says hidden while the frame
-- says shown is the fault, and the column it lands in names the layer to fix.
--
-- ☠ EVERY IsShown IS GUARDED. A container nested in another container's slot inherits a
-- SECRET shown state, and tostring() on a secret makes the whole print VANISH rather than
-- error -- an unguarded read would silently drop the very rows worth seeing.
-- ☠ Keys are pipe-escaped, same as the idgate dump: AD keys use "|" as a field separator
-- and raw pipes blank an EditBox on paste.

-- NOTES — 12.1 CASUALTIES (P4.2): framealpha / nametext / healthtext
-- The attach-and-inherit trick shows a slot-CHILD region on presence, letting Blizzard's
-- secret show/hide drive it read-free. It works for effects that ARE a child region drawn
-- over the frame (tint textures, a border ring). It does NOT extend to these three:
--
--  * framealpha (ref the legacy Indicators:ApplyFrameAlpha; that module is gone) — reduces the WHOLE unit frame's alpha on
--    presence. There is no additive-child equivalent to reducing a frame's alpha (an overlay
--    darkens, it can't make the frame transparent — and the plan forbids approximation).
--    The only mechanism would be an OnShow/OnHide hook on a slot child calling frame:SetAlpha
--    — which (a) isn't part of DF.AuraContainer's supported style API (runs insecure Lua off
--    a native button's secret-driven visibility, the taint-adjacent touch the engine warns
--    against), and (b) collides with DF's existing frame-alpha owners (range fade / OOR
--    re-assert alpha every update) with no arbitration layer. → casualty. P4.7 overlays the
--    framealpha type's controls (and its Expiring group).
--
--  * nametext / healthtext — RECOVERED (colour-by-cover). Originally written off: the
--    real fontstring can't be recoloured (presence-gated call on a secret), and a clone
--    was thought impossible for health text ("the string is secret in combat"). Both
--    conclusions fell to the secret-passthrough finding: FontStrings ACCEPT secret
--    values, so the Text Designer feeds a duplicate cover FontString the SAME resolved
--    font + SafeText value it gives the real element (glyph-identical by construction,
--    zero reads — TextDesigner/Render.lua EnableMirrors), and the cover rides an AD
--    overlay slot's secret visibility. See the NAME / HEALTH TEXT block in SyncFrame.
--    Residual limits: expiring colour swaps stay dead (remaining-time), text SWM is
--    unsupported, inline |c codes in group items keep their embedded colour, and the
--    cover ignores the OOR text fade (it lives outside the TD overlay).

-- ☠ (Removed) a file-scope `DF:Debug(DBG, "Factory (native AD bridge) loaded")`. It could
-- never print: DebugConsole:Init binds debugDb from ADDON_LOADED, long after every file
-- has been parsed, so a log call at chunk level is a guaranteed no-op -- it allocated its
-- argument and returned nothing, in every session this addon has ever run. The same trap
-- is documented in Core.lua's migration trace, which buffers until the console exists.
-- Anything that genuinely needs to report at load must use that buffer, not a bare call.
